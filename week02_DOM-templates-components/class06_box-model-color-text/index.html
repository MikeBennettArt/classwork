    <p>There are no limits in this world. It is a lot of fun. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>

<p>Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Work that paint. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>

<p>At home you have unlimited time. The least little bit can do so much. Brown is such a nice color. And just raise cain.</p>

<p>Imagination is the key to painting. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>

<p>Let's have a little bit of fun today. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.</p>

<p>These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Isn't that fantastic? Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.</p>

<p>In your world you can create anything you desire. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>
