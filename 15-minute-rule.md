15 Minute Rule
===

You are being asked to not go more than 15 minutes without making progress (aka "stuck").

## Why?

1. Take ownership of delivery
1. Prioritize practice
1. Practice talking tech
1. Learn to ask better questions
1. Be energized, avoid frustration

## Take Ownership

* You are practicing being responsible for delivering code. 
* It's not about you!
* Be tenacious and seek optimal outcomes

## Prioritize Practice

You are not practicing when you are stuck. Cumulatively this means very few LOC written.

## Practice Talking Tech

Asking questions requires you to verbalize what you are learning.

## Learn to Ask Better Questions

Don't tell stories, be succint and to the point:

1. What are you expecting?
1. What is actually happening?

Identify step in process:

1. Have a clearly defined next step in relation to prior step
    1. What was last working step?
    1. What is step you want to complete?
1. What **is** happening?
1. What have you tried?

Do the research:

1. **Dev Tools OPEN ALWAYS!!!**
1. What information is available (aka Read the Error)?
1. Observe details
    1. Error message typically has problem and file/line number
    1. What actually happens?
1. What hypothesis have you made and tested?

## Be Energized

1. Moving through and completing required work in a reasonable amount of time gives you a sense of accomplishment and engerizes you to go deeper with the time you now have. 

1. Constant struggle and laborious process is _demoralizing_ and keeps you at _surface learning_.
