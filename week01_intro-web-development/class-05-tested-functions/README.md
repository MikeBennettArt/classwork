## Testing

* What does "it works" mean?
* What is an error?

* Is code atomic or made up of pieces?

## Agenda

This is an exercise in thinking about thinking about coding and software development.

The domain problem is intentional simple, so you can focus on the process and mechanics

## Part 0

Setup: 

1. Fork assignment and set upstream remote
1. Work on a branch so you can go back to master if necessary
1. Split VSCode and Browser Dev Tools

## Part 1

Create a test runner and assertion library

## Part 2

Use our library to create tested calculator functions
used in a calculator app

(NOTE: we will work horizontal to better show the mechanics. Once you know the technique, work vertically)

## Part 3

Create a simple Calculator App that uses our functions
