Intro to Object, Array, Function
===

## Agenda

* Object as Dictionary
* Functions
* Strings are "Array like"
* CSS Selectors and `document.querySelectorAll()`

## Big Three

Data Structure | Description
---|---
`Object`       | Set of properties that describe an entity (thing)
`Array`        | Kind of Object that stores list of things
`Functions`    | Kind of Object with superpowers (unleashed via `()`)
`Dictionaries` | Objects that track things by key(or Maps or Lookups)

**Graphs:** Combinatorial Powers!

## Functions

* Reuse behavior (encapsulate)
* Code "on demand" (control flow)
* Inputs and Outputs

### Types

1. **Named functions**
1. Function expressions
1. Arrow functions

## CSS Selectors

1. Big Three:
    1. tag `p`
    1. class `.`
    1. id `#`
1. parent child
    1. any `parent child`
    1. direct `parent > child`
1. combined `selector1, selector2, selector3`
1. attributes
    1. `input[type=radio]`

## `document.querySelectorAll`

1. Apply a selector, get back a node list
1. Like an array (but not), can be looped

## Demo

Random pair generator

## Pair Programming

Here's the basics of what you need to know about *pair programming*. This is a methodology for work in software development that is increasingly more popular and widespread (not only in development work, but also in interview processes), and we place a high value on training our students to pair program effectively.

Consistency between the code base in all four locations: their GitHub account, their personal computer, their partner's GitHub account, and their partner's personal computer. Encourage students to ask for a reminder during lab time if they forget any of the steps.

* In pair programming there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
* One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop. The Driver will be working on the Navigator's code by way of forking and cloning the Navigator's repository.
* The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
* The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop "on the side". The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas. At most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
* Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they're working on together.
* Pairs **must switch every 25 minutes**. Students should swap roles and work on the other person's code. **You must use a timer**.
* In the case of an odd number of students, one group will have three members and they should rotate through three roles: Driver, Navigator, Observer. Each student should take on each role one time.
