## ES Modules

### Basics

* Each file is independent scope
* Explicitly `import` from other modules by relative file path
* Explicitly `export` what is exposed to other modules

## Default and Named

* If a module exports one main thing, use `export default`. This is what you are
going to use 90% of the time.
* If a module exports more than one thing, use `export`
